Sumary 

- Counting Occurences: determine how often each number has appeared 
- Calculating Pobabilities: Converts this counts into probabilities
- Normalizing Probabilities: Ensures the sum of probabilities is 1.
Wighted random Sampling: Ises theses probabilities to randomly select numbers, giving preference to those that appeared more frequently in the past.

This approach that ensures that th e numbers with higher probability more likely to be selected in future draws. thereby statistically favoring them.
